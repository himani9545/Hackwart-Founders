## 🧠 What It Does

🧙 Magical Traffic Optimizer uses **AI (YOLOv8)** to analyze real-time traffic from 4 different lanes (North, East, South, West) and **automatically chooses the lane that deserves the green signal** — all through the lens of magic and machine learning!

## 🎥 How It Works

1. Upload short traffic videos for all 4 lanes 📸
2. Click the **"Cast Signal Optimizing Spell"** button 🪄
3. Our AI counts the vehicles using YOLOv8 🚗
4. Lane with the most traffic is blessed with the **green signal** 🟢
5. Rest lanes receive the **"Expelliarmus" STOP Signal** 🔴
