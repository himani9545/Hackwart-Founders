# ✨ Hogwarts Flow Master 🚦

> *"Mischief Managed... and so is the Traffic!"*  
> A **Harry Potter–themed AI-based Traffic Signal Optimizer** built for **Triwizardathon 2025** 🪄  
> Brought to life by the legendary team: **Hackwarts Founders**

## 🧠 What It Does

**Hogwarts Flow Master** is a magical AI system that analyzes real-time traffic footage from four directions — **North**, **East**, **South**, and **West** — and determines **which lane should get the green signal** based on vehicle density.

Using a combination of **YOLOv8** for vehicle detection and a **Streamlit UI** for interaction, we bring together the wizarding world and cutting-edge technology.

## 🧪 Tech Stack Used

| 🪄 Magical Artifact | 💻 Muggle Technology      |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| 🧙 YOLOv8            | Ultralytics Object Detection |
| 🧠 Streamlit         | Real-time Python UI        |
| 🖼 OpenCV            | Frame Processing           |
| 🐍 Python            | The core magic             |

## 🎥 How It Works

1. 🧳 Upload **four short traffic videos** (one per direction).
2. 🔮 Click **"Cast Signal Optimizing Spell"**.
3. 🚗 YOLOv8 processes the **first frame** of each video to detect vehicles.
4. 🟢 The direction with the **highest count** gets the green signal.
5. 🔴 Other directions are shown red ("Expelliarmus Signal").
